> #### Present Tales is a multifaceted arts collective and independent reissue record label based in Augsburg (Germany) and Miami (U.S). As a label, we archive, promote and celebrate peculiar moments in music while paying homage to those responsible for them. Through this process, we aim to shed light on musical oddities which we believe should be accessible to a new generation of listeners.
